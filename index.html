				<h1>I'm Christopher</h1>
				<p class="sub-paragraph-callout">
					Born in Canada, Christopher has always loved technology and computers. He is driven by the need to learn new things. He is an entrepreneur, a solution provider, someone who enjoys test driving new ideas and planning product roadmaps. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently, as the director of digital marketing at Keck Medicine of USC, my main focus is to add strategy to the competitive landscape of health care. Working with internal teams of developers, stakeholders and digital agencies I am able to craft product roadmaps to help the organization move into the future.

					<h1>My Strengths</h1>
					<p>
						I have been in technology for more than 12 years and along the way I have managed to pick up a few skills. While knowledge of technology is important, communication, idea generation and leadership are qualities that are in high demand.
